# Java Full Stack Test

# Story
You are providing a service to a charted airplane company. This fiction company LINKIT AIR has the following flights daily (times are in departure city time):

* 09:55 - Amsterdam to London 

* 13:15 - London to Amsterdam

* 10:45 - Amsterdam to Frankfurt

* 14:35 - Frankfurt to London

They want to get rid of some of travel agents and make it easier to customers to buy their tickets, so they need to develop a simple sales website. 
At the same time, they want to gather some statistics about this service.

## Time limit
Up to you on how much effort you want to spend and how perfect you want it to be. 
Your **deadline is on Monday, November 26th, 23:59:59**. Anything commited/requested/pushed after this will not be considered.

## Assignment
Create a REST Service, preferably using SPRING. Following the HTTP standards.  
The user interface requires a dedicated backend that supports it, build this in the provided template using spring-boot.
Provide documentation for your API as SWAGGER or RAMEL
Create a Simple User Interface
Create a web user interface where a customer of the site could do the following:

* Be able to select an origin.
* Be able to select a destination.
* Retrieve a fare offer for the given origin-destination combination.
* Selections for origin and/or destination should be searchable, in other words the customer should be able to find an origin or destination by providing a few characters that would match either an airport code, name or description. The user interface may be in any technique that you feel comfortable with.

The authentication is on application level, so make sure the user interface is not bothered with authentication. There is no need for a login to purchase tickets.
Add statistics for your backend
To get some input on our application usage we need to collect and store some information from its traffic. Retrieve and store the require values below:

* Total number of requests processed

* Total number of requests resulted in an OK, 4xx and 5xx responses

* Average response time of all requests

* Min response time of all requests

* Max response time of all requests

To not only store this data expose this information in a new restful endpoint as JSON and provide a dashboard to visualise this info. How to authenticate the access to this dashboard, it is up to you.

Collecting metrics should not impact the user experience in any way.
Make the application configurable. No hard coded values for things like endpoints, etc. Everything should be configurable in some kind of configuration file.

## Bonus points - Modular Frontend 
Create a separate build for your frontend (using npm or whatever you want)
Build your frontend in angular (which version is up to your own preference)
Make sure that somehow your resulting artifact is included and exposed in your boot project.
Instead of using hardcoded mocked data, you can create in memory data-base, with actualy a respository.

Show us your knowledge of java up to and including the latest released version!

# Summary #
By no means is the goal to get a solution covering all special cases in a 100% robust way. Requiring this would be naive given the time limit! It's important that you can explain why you chose your solution instead of another. You can create mock data and values that make no sense (like fare prices and so on). Feel free!

At least the functionality that you deliver should be error free. What you implement and how you do it is subject to your creativity and ambition :-). Good luck!

## How do I submit it? ##
* Create your branch and keep pushing your changes. 
* Create and explain in a Markdown about your decisions in the process.
* When it is done, let your LINKIT contact know about it via Pull Request.
* Give instructions in a readme file so that anyone with a unix machine (Mac or any Linux Disto) could download the repo and run the service on their `localhost`.
